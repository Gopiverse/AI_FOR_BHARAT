#  Design Document — The Zero-Waste Chef

> *A Multimodal AI System for Rebuilding Meals from Existing Ingredients*

---

##  1. System Overview

**The Zero-Waste Chef** is an AI-powered mobile application that transforms images of fridge or pantry contents into intelligent, waste-minimizing recipes.  
The system combines **computer vision**, **multimodal LLMs**, and **agentic workflows** to eliminate *fridge paralysis* and promote sustainable cooking.
